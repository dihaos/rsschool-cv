## About me:

I am a frontend developer. More than 2 years in this field. I like to write websites and web applications where you need to solve complex problems. I am also layout, but it does not bring me much pleasure. I focus on the result, so that the user is comfortable and understands everything.

## Skills:

- HTML
- CSS
- SASS (SCSS)
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Git
- React
- Redux
- Webpack

## Code Example:

```
const rps = (p1, p2) => {
  const priorities = ['scissors', 'paper', 'rock']
  const index_p1 = priorities.indexOf(p1)
  const index_p2 = priorities.indexOf(p2)
  const result = Math.abs(index_p1 - index_p2)

  if(result === 1){
    return index_p1 < index_p2 ? "Player 1 won!" : "Player 2 won!"
  }else if(result === 2){
    return index_p1 > index_p2 ? "Player 1 won!" : "Player 2 won!"
  }else return "Draw!"
};

```
